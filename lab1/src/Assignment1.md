# Assignment 1
### By Christian Weersink 100791903

Lab 1 write up can be found in the drop down.
Pagination Test is my first attempt at using pagination.

Music Quiz is a short quiz on some of my favourite bands.

## In the code
Quiz.ejs uses pagination to display data from quiz.json, which is found in _data. The functionality of the quiz is handled by quiz.js, in the public/js/ folder. 
People.ejs was my first attempt at pagination and contains some simple data, displayed in pages with 10 items per page.

### Bonus Marks
### SASS 
The SCSS can be found in public/css. In this file I demonstrate use of `@mixin`s and `@import`s. I store all of my colours for the site in a separate _colours.scss file and use them on the 'people list' in people.ejs.
