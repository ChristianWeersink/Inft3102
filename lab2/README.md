For maintenance, check DatoCMS for any content issues, 11ty for any build issues.

For scaling and adding more content types, create a template similar to posts or people.ejs, create a content type on DatoCMS, create a js file in _data to fetch the data, optionally add an 11ty tag in the eleventy.config.js, and then include the data in the new template.
